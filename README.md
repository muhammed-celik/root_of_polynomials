# root_of_polynomials
Finding a root of given polynomials using Secant and Bisection methods

-Program takes coefficients of the function f(x), two inital guesses and tolerance value.
-It prints out the number of iterations executed by each of the three methods and corresponding roots.

-Program prints out a message if user give all coefficients "0" of the function (f(x) = 0 constant function) saying that all real axis is solution.
-To prevent infinite loops, each method has a maximum number of iterations (given as 10000).
